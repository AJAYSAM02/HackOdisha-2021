# Problem We Solve
Online Hackathons were a new way to conduct hackathons and it sounded interesting but it also carried its own set of problems. The major issue was duplicate project submission. Participants are developing one project and submitting them in multiple hackathons which hugely diminishes the aim of such hackathons. We have even personally have seen multiple projects like these. To prevent such malpractices we have created a website that checks all the submissions of the current hackathon and finds out the duplicate ones by comparing various parameters of the project.
